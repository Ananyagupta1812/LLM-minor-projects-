# LLM Practical Experiments

This repository contains the code and resources for 10 practical experiments demonstrating the use of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** in various NLP tasks such as text generation, fine-tuning, summarization, machine translation, multimodal reasoning, reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), and code generation.

These experiments were implemented as part of an academic practical course to understand, explore, and apply LLM techniques effectively.

## 📖 Overview
The repository explores a wide range of LLM concepts and practical tasks:
- Transformer-based text generation
- Domain-specific LLM fine-tuning
- Summarization and translation using LLMs
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as **LoRA**
- Multimodal LLMs for image-text question answering
- Prompt engineering for better model guidance
- RLHF to align model outputs with human preferences
- LLM-based code generation and evaluation

Each experiment is implemented in a Jupyter notebook with sections for **Aim, Theory, and Code**.
